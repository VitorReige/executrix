 imperial_interceptor_tech_research: "Interceptor Technology Research"
 laat_equipment_desc: "The LAAT was a heavily armed troop transport, capable of clearing a landing zone with it’s 360 degree field of fire, as well as being able to defend itself from enemy air attacks. It was capable of transporting up to three squads of troopers, or up to four speeder bikes; an incredible boost to mobility for our ground army, which currently lacks any form of quick transport."
 maat_equipment_desc: "The MAAT was the Imperial evolution of the LAAT, with increased armor to enable a greater survivability; a common problem of the late LAAT. The MAAT was in all respects capable of anything that the LAAT was able, but to more extremes; being able to land in nearly any weather and even move to the outer atmosphere of a planet. This will do well, as we can reach an elevation to high for enemy anti aircraft weaponry to target our craft until the moment we descent."
 idt_equipment_desc: "The Imperial Dropship Transport was in all respects, an imperialized version of the earlier LAAT platform. Its design was intended to be more aggressive to the enemy, while being smaller and more nimble to avoid enemy interception and fire once it began its descent. As we move to take on opponents fielding larger air wings, this will be a necessary advantage to increase the survivability of our landing troopers."
 tie-rp_equipment_desc: "The TIE Reaper was a dropship featured in the TIE series of Imperial starfighters, taking on the iconic paint scheme and solar wings. It took many design considerations from the TIE Striker, specifically built for operations within the atmosphere of a planet. It functions similarly to a fighter, with its speed being greater than any aircraft fielded by the natives of this planet; allowing for us to more rapidly deploy and wreak havoc among our enemies battle lines."
 tie-rb_equipment_desc: "The TIE/RB was designed as a heavy support craft, featuring an extra pod housing two external laser cannons to provide heavy firepower to ground and air targets. A droid brain controlled the secondary turrets, allowing the pilot to more easily fly the craft and control the main weapons."
 aal_equipment_desc: "The Atmospheric Assault Lander was a heavily armored transport intended for use in situations of heavy enemy fire. It came equipped with a deflector shield generator in order to further protect the occupants until the moment of landing, as well as a dedicated weapons system for clearing the immediate area around the landing zone and supporting disembarking troopers. A heavy lander is exactly what we require, as our enemies continue to develop heavier guns capable of destroying our previous models."
 torrent_equipment_desc: "The V-19 was the mainstay of the Republic Starfighter Corps for good reason; it was cheap to produce and was an effective all around fighter and light air support. It had folding wing foils for added maneuverability, as well as two laser cannons on each wing tip and six concussion missiles. It works well in atmosphere as well, a fact we will take advantage of as our need for a cheap, easily produced starfighter becomes more apparent."
 z-95_equipment_desc: "The need for a craft more adequate at dealing with enemy aircraft is clear, and our solution is the Z-95 Headhunter. As we draw nearer to our goal of producing our own TIE series starfighters draws closer, we must produce a fighter capable of holding off enemy craft until then. Armed with two triple laser cannons and two concussion missile launchers, the Z-95 is capable of annihilating enemy aircraft with extreme lethality, yet at the cost of maneuverability. It will prove capable in a limited role, providing much better ground support than its predecessor."
 tie-sf_equipment_desc: "The TIE/SF was a further improvement upon the earlier TIE/LN starfighter, with a crew of two for increased efficiency in weapon control. It featured a rotating twin laser cannon and variable warhead launcher as well as the standard two laser cannons, allowing it to fire at targets both in front and behind simultaneously. A significant improvement upon an iconic design, one we are going to use extensively. "
 y-wing_equipment_desc: "The BTL was the workhorse of the Republic navy, being an effective bomber for years after its evolution into the Empire. Armed with a variety of loadouts from ion cannons to concussion missiles, they are a versatile, survivable starfighter to serve our needs of a dedicated bomber."
 skipray_equipment_desc: "The Skipray was a capable bomber, technically classed as a capital ship due to its immense power output. It was armed with three ion cannons capable of stopping the nervous system of any living being hit directly by the blast, a tractor beam capable of stopping some craft mid air, two laser cannons, and a proton torpedo launcher. It was less maneuverable, however when used in a bomber capacity and escorted properly, it was an incredibly effective ground strike craft."
 scimitar_equipment_desc: "The Scimitar Assault Bomber was the final evolution of the TIE bomber series, featuring 16 separate missile racks capable of targeting multiple targets simultaneously; the unprecedented firepower carried within the Scimitar allow for us to use a single starfighter to decimate an entire enemy armored spearhead."
 tie-in_equipment_desc: "The TIE Interceptor was the logical successor to the V-Wing in the TIE series. It was faster, more heavily armed, and capable of withstanding blows that would have destroyed the lightly armored V-Wing. With six total laser cannons able to fire simultaneously on the same target, no craft will be able to withstand a pass from our iconic, deadly starfighter."
 tie-sk_equipment_desc: "The TIE Striker was a dedicated atmospheric fighter, able to perform significantly better than other interceptors or fighters due to not being required to be able to go into the depths of space. Armed with six laser cannons and a proton bomb launcher, it was capable of shredding air opponents and never being hit. Truely a fearsome sight in the skies, the Striker will be a welcome addition to our growing arsenal."
 tie-vn_equipment_desc: "The TIE Vengeance was one of the fastest starfighters available, easily overwhelming lesser pilots leading to crashes. Featuring shields, six laser cannons, and two concussion missile launchers, this starfighter was a terror in the skies. It is also capable of foiling enemy sensors, allowing it to remain undetected until a pilot or ground crew can directly see it. This evolution is the next iteration of the Imperial Air Corps."
 tie-ba_equipment_desc: "The TIE Baron was similar to the Vengeance, equipped with a hyperdrive and a new paint scheme deviating from the standard Imperial grey. This was a tactic intended to enrage our enemies, taunting them with a target they can never hope to match."
 arc-170_equipment_desc: "The ARC-170 was an incredible fighter/bomber, capable of holding its own in a firefight as well as providing ground support in an equal capacity. It was equipped with two medium laser cannons and proton torpedoes as its primary offensive suite, with a twin laser cannon in a ball turret on its rear in order to provide improved defense. Its heavier shields compared to that of other starfighters in its class allow it to survive incredible amounts of damage. This is the perfect starfighter to keep up with the increasing needs of air support by the Imperial Army."

 #descriptions
 spha_equipment_desc: "The SPHA was a heavy artillery vehicle bearing a modular weapon mount, allowing it to be adapted to a variety of combat situations. Its main weapon was typically a starship level turbolaser, capable of tremendous destructive power. The primary disadvantage of this weapon however was that it required line of sight to the target, a large drawback compared to the indirect fire of traditional artillery. This will still suit our need for heavy firepower however, until we are capable of developing further artillery."
 spma_equipment_desc: "The SPMA-T was an advanced self propelled artillery piece, armed with a variable trajectory turbolaser. This allowed it to not only change the angle of fire, but also the power of the projectile fired; this allowed it to adapt to whatever the current target may have been. The range it is capable of will be an incredible boon to our ground assaults, as we will no longer require a line of sight to our targets in order to be within range of firing."
 infantry_support_platform_desc: "The ISP sacrifices reconnaissance for firepower and survivability, something we must prioritize in these harsh times while we reorganize our forces. It will allow us to harass our enemies with hit and run tactics, while also providing forward intelligence to our frontline commanders. "
 barc_equipment_desc: "The BARC was a versatile speeder used by the late Galactic Republic, able to have a variety of attachments and weapons added onto it as the situation evolved. This will be useful to us, as reconnaissance is vital to our army in order to be able to effectively perform combat operations, which the BARC excels at. "
 ava_equipment_desc: "The 614 is a measurable improvement over the BARC, offering greater maneuverability and speed at the loss of modularity. It is significantly easier to use for our pilots, as well as easier to maintain and store as it can fold in on itself, allowing it to be stored inside of other transport vehicles and be deployed where necessary, or even carried in the field by troopers to be deployed at their discretion."
 z_speeder_equipment_desc: "The 74-Z is the speeder used by the Reconnaissance Troopers of the rest of the Empire for good reason, as it is the fastest speeder available while still being safe to pilot for our pilots. It also comes equipped with adequate firepower to harass light enemy formations and fortifications while allowing for our own troopers to return safely with any intelligence that they may have gathered while on mission."
 atrct_equipment_desc: "The AT-RTC was a variant of the AT-RT specialized in urban suppression, with a height tall enough to see over large crowds and multiple rotating blaster cannons intended for crowd suppression. This walker will suit us well in quelling any regions with a particularly large resistance to Imperial occupation."
 atap_equipment_desc: "The AT-AP was a multi-purpose walker designed for fire support against armored enemy targets during the Clone Wars. It used a large caliber mass driver cannon as its main armament, allowing it to inflict greater damage upon heavily armored vehicles. The gun generated incredible recoil, so much so that a third leg was required to be deployed when firing to stabilize itself. The issue compounded, as continuous firing required that its firing mechanisms be replaced often due to the recoil generated."
 av7_equipment_desc: "The AV-7 was a dedicated anti vehicle cannon mounted on a repulsorlift chassis, making it capable of rapid deployment in the field. The only thing capable of stopping the tremendous firepower output from the cannons is a shield, something our enemies have no access to. No enemy armor can withstand our superior firepower."
 atot_equipment_desc: "The AT-OT was a heavily armored, yet open topped, vehicle used for transporting large amounts of cargo and troops across long distances. It was armed with four laser cannons, however rarely saw combat as it was used to quickly transport large numbers of troops around the battlefield to handle combat. It is an old design, but reliable; it shall serve us well in moving our stormtroopers across large battlefields in intense combat situations."
 rtt_equipment_desc: "The RTT was an incredibly fast troop transport, able to hold its own in combat as well if supported. It featured two laser cannons as well as two mass driver missile launchers, however its light armor limited its role to ferrying troops rather than a direct firesupport tank. Its speed will allow us to move quickly into and out of combat situations and perform a variety of maneuvers around enemy formations before they are able to react."
 itt_equipment_desc: "The ITT is the logical combination of its predecessors, combining speed with armor and fighting capacity. It is able to withstand more damage than the RTT, while having greater firepower. It is faster than the AT-OT, and cheaper to produce while still being able to transport a limited number of troopers into battle. This will do us well seeing as how our enemies are developing larger guns capable of more destructive firepower."
 itc_equipment_desc: "The ITC is a wheeled counterpart to the ITT, offering a better experience for its crew with more space and accommodating controls. It has a 360 degree twin laser cannon turret mounted on its top, allowing for the gunner to hit targets regardless of the vehicle's orientation. It is also raised further from the ground to help avoid enemy mines and other ground ordinance, a problem found in previous vehicle designs."
 juggernaut_equipment_desc: "The Juggernaut is an older design from the days of the Republic, but possibly one of the most complex and heavily armored ground vehicles in the Imperial Army. It boasts the capacity to hold an immense number of troopers, while being able to fend off enemy armored targets as well as aircraft while taking no damage itself. It is incredibly costly, but even a few dispersed amongst our armored battalions will turn the tide of battle hastily."
 mauler_equipment_desc: "The Mauler was an attempt to utilize the TIE platform in a ground vehicle role, sharing many of the same components of its starfighter counterparts. It was equipped with three repeating laser cannons for shredding lightly armored targets and capable of incredible speed, however it too shared the drawbacks of all early TIE craft, no shielding and a weak structure not capable of withstanding heavy enemy fire. This is a stepping stone on the path to a heavier craft, but still useful nonetheless."
 crawler_equipment_desc: "The Crawler was the more successful TIE ground platform, featuring heavier armor and improved weapons. It had dual medium laser cannons for dealing with nearly all targets, and a retractable light turbolaser capable of blasting away heavy enemy fortifications with ease. This craft will suit our needs for a fast, heavy vehicle that is able to advance behind enemy lines or support our own troopers by destroying enemy field fortifications."
 px_equipment_desc: "The PX-10 was well suited for providing armored support for Imperial garrisons where enemy resistance was not expected to be extreme. It was a single man tank, armed with a single medium laser cannon capable of destroying enemy armored targets with ease. Its armor made it impervious to enemy small arms fire, and even a variety of anti tank weaponry. This is the perfect platform for helping to secure our growing territory."
 h_repulsor_equipment_desc: "The 1-H is a sidestep in our progress, as it uses similar concepts to the Saber platform. It is armed to deal with large amounts of lightly armored targets at once, with rotating turrets capable of firing in all directions. It has no shields, but is heavily armored, making it resistant to anything except more dedicated anti tank weapons. It is however prone to breaking down in bad weather conditions, something that has frequently been mentioned by its crews."
 atm6_equipment_desc: "The AT-M6 was developed alongside the First Order AT-AT as a more heavily armed variant, boasting a full turbolaser cannon on its back to provide firepower capable of destroying entire bunkers, and anything else in its path. It also had larger feet to allow increased stability when walking on unstable terrain, essentially preventing it from being toppled. Mass deployment of walkers of this caliber will ensure our absolute victory, with no enemy capable of withstanding firepower from even a lone walker."
 rx_equipment_desc: "As we push into enemies with a significant air presence, we require dedicated anti air weapons for when we cannot maintain an air presence over every battalion in our army. The RX-200 is an excellent candidate for the position, as it uses a heavy ship based ion cannon to disable all electrical systems in an enemy plane (and potentially the nervous system of its pilot) in a split second. This will be a wonderful tool for disabling enemy high altitude bombers that most guns would be incapable of reaching."
 ataa_equipment_desc: "The AT-AA was a far cry from its predecessor in that it utilized a fast firing flak missile system to target multiple enemy aircraft at once rather than single targets. It provides a significant advantage in firepower, and is also capable of inflicting more destruction upon ground targets. A perfect multiuse tool to support our troopers against threats from above and at ground level."

 atte_equipment_desc: "The AT-TE was a successful multirole walker utilized extensively during the Clone Wars as an anti vehicle and infantry platform. Unlike later designs, the AT-TE was low to the ground with six legs in order to achieve incredible stability, as well as to provide redundancy in the event one leg was to be destroyed during combat. The largest feature was its ability to climb vertical surfaces, allowing any combination of tactics for surprise tactics or ambush opportunities. This walker will be well suited until we are able to get accustomed to this planet, as it provides a quality basis with which to further our ambitions."
 atdp_equipment: "AT-DP"
 atdp_equipment_desc: "The AT-DP was the successor to the AT-PT, improved in many ways. It’s biggest advantage over its predecessor was an upgraded blaster cannon, capable of piercing heavier armor while still being protected from any small arms. It was also significantly taller, allowing its heavier cannon to fire at a longer distance with fewer obstacles in its path. This will do perfectly compared to the lightly armored resistance we find ourselves pitted against, as well as demoralize enemy ground infantry."
 atpt_equipment: "AT-PT"
 atpt_equipment_desc: "The AT-PT allows us to make a single trooper into a walking weapons platform from which our standard troopers can rally and advance with.

 elite_atat_equipment: "AT-AT"
 elite_atat_equipment_desc: "The Imperial AT-AT could be felt coming before it could be seen, a feature deliberately used to demoralize enemy opposition; something that sometimes made them retreat before combat even began. Its armor could only be pierced by heavy weapons mounted on starfighters, or vehicles intentionally armed with weapons capable of piercing armor such as found on the AT-AT. This will be a wonderful war machine for ruining our enemies, one that our troopers will be delighted to see once again."

 tarkin_desc: "Wilhuff Tarkin is one of the most powerful individuals in the Galactic Empire, a Grand Moff who shaped Imperial doctrine and was the driving force behind the creation of its key embodiment, the Death Star. Born on Eriadu to the powerful and militaristic Human Tarkin family, the ambitious Tarkin began his career by serving in the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. He then retired and entered politics, becoming lieutenant governor of Eriadu and the Seswenna sector, before returning to the military in order to serve Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as an agent of the secret Sith Lord's New Order movement."
 darth_vader_desc: "Now in possession of a great amount of power, Vader began settling into his position as Palpatine's enforcer. However, several members of the Empire viewed Vader as being mad human wreckage. Although in possession of great wealth, Vader allowed himself few comforts. Among those were his personal retreat on Coruscant and Bast Castle on Vjun. The 501st Legion, the stormtrooper division he led in the extermination of the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, became his personal guard. The actions they undertook in Vader's name over the course of the Civil War earned them the nickname of 'Vader's Fist'."
 Malsuum_desc: "Due to his abandonment during battle, Hock hated the Jedi. During the Clone Wars, he had considered them to be fearless warriors, but believed others could be fearless even without a lightsaber, and that even Jedi could make mistakes. He acknowledged the fact that he was created by the Kaminoans for a purpose, and could take pride in that. He also believed he was a machine with unlimited replacements, meaning that each was equally unimportant. He also considered that he was trained to fight well. To him, loyalty is a choice, and was loyal to Darth Vader and the Empire until the hospital massacre. During the Shrouded Offensive, he saw Vader do unspeakable things, and knew that the lack of humanity would haunt his memory. He then realized his respect for the warrior had been misplaced."

Look on our new military not as trespassers or interlopers, but as gatekeepers, here to shore up the Emperor's vision of a pacified and prosperous galaxy." - Wilhuff Tarkin on his Doctrine for the Imperial Armed Forces\n\nThe Imperial Military, also referred to as the Imperial Armed Forces, comprised the various branches of the armed forces of the Galactic Empire, such as the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy and the Stormtrooper Corps, as well as agencies such as Imperial Intelligence. Formed as a realignment of the Republic Military following the Clone Wars and the transformation from Galactic Republic to the Empire, the nascent Imperial Military was tasked with enforcement across the Empire and was used for suppressing planetary uprisings, continuing the Great Jedi Purge and chasing holdouts of the Confederacy of Independent Systems."

 imp_rapid_industrialization_desc: "As it stands, our state economy is incredibly weak compared to the natives; a problem that we must remedy quickly before we find ourselves out matched, unable to arm our men. By rapidly constructing factories in a preplanned, prefabricated manner we can reduce construction time considerably."
 imp_elitism: "Elitism"
 imp_elitism_desc: "By becoming one of the world's primary sources of oil, we have placed ourselves high above any of our neighboring countries, and even above the ‘Major Powers’. A sense of elitism is justified, as this world revolves around oil to power its war machines, granting us a large advantage if we were to decide to no longer export any."

 imp_exploitation: "Exploitation"
 imp_exploitation_desc: "While having the capacity to build many weapons at once is wonderful, we lack the raw materials to do so. Many of our factories sit idle as they await shipments of material to work with, wasting valuable time. There are many displaced laborers, out of work due to Imperial mining machines replacing them at their job. We can use them as cheap labor to provide a boost to our resource extraction output."
 imp_new_headquarters: "New Headquarters"
 imp_new_headquarters_desc: "Constructing a new headquarters with which to base ourselves from would allow for increased work efficiency for our men, as working from the Executor gives a feeling of only being on this planet temporarily.

 imp_the_senate: "The Imperial Senate"
 imp_the_senate_desc: "Appointing a Senate will allow for our citizens to have a voice in our policy, however the Senate will ultimately still be under our control if the public were to vote in an unfavorable way. The Senate will allow for citizens to decide their own way of life, something we shall allow as long as it does not affect our own intentions."
 imp_gulf_city: "New Coruscant"
 imp_gulf_city_desc: "New Coruscant, our growing metropolis to the west of the crash site, is becoming a major hub of activity in this region of the world.

It also housed the structural plans for the ship, as well as technical plans for the majority of our starfighters and walkers aboard. Restoration will be a long process, but a necessary one."
 imp_technology_for_our_subjects_desc: "Allowing limited amounts of our arms to be reproduced by those we have puppeted will allow for them to keep pace with our own troopers in the field instead of lagging behind struggling to keep up with our rate of advance. Even our older models will be an incredible boost to the strength of their forces."
 imp_one_authority_one_planet_desc: "Our technology belongs in our hands, any leasing of designs will simply result in our enemies having an easier time stealing our weapons. We will one day rule this planet like countless others, regardless of the opinion of the inhabitants."

 imp_overwhelming_offense_desc: "By having an incredibly large number of tanks at our disposal, we will be able to overwhelm our enemies with vast armored charges that they cannot hope to repel."
 imp_a_comprehensive_history_on_tanks_desc: "By studying past tank designs, we can gain insight into what makes an effective vehicle for our situation, and apply that to future design to better suit our needs in our ever changing theater of war."
 imp_faults_in_designs_desc: "Studying previous tank models have pointed to flaws present in multiple tanks over multiple designs, all compounding on top of one another. Tank design has been flawed for many years, and now we may begin to improve based upon our findings."

 imp_kuat_light_vehicles_desc: "Using practices derived from Kuat, we can improve our own walkers by ourselves. Improving the quality of our walkers instead of focusing on improving production will aid us more in the future, as a walker still standing after a battle is more important than one left destroyed."
 imp_stick_with_what_works_desc: "Utilizing older designs we can begin production of walkers sooner rather than later, still allowing us to provide our troops with armored support; albeit not the walkers our troopers are accustomed to seeing."
 imp_bomber_models: "Bomber Models"
 imp_walkers_in_every_battalion_desc: "Making sure every trooper deployment also has walker support will ensure that we have adequate support, as our enemies cannot hope to withstand our combined arms when deployed in numbers. A single walker is not a threat, but a squadron is unstoppable."
 imp_reinstate_heavier_models_desc: "Using heavier walkers alongside our troopers on foot will allow for our army to slowly but surely roll over our enemies, laying waste to any obstacles in their path. Our superior firepower will annihilate our enemies."
 imp_war_doctrine_refinement_desc: "Planning our assaults in greater detail will allow our tank crews to take greater advantage of their armor and speed by detailing missions behind enemy lines to cut off and surround pockets of men, allowing our regular forces to move in and wipe them out."
 imp_bomber_models_desc: "Bombers are a particularly important tool we must utilize, as our enemies have no chance of gaining air superiority over us as it stands. If we focus on our bomber effort, we can destroy any land opposition we come across with ease."
 imp_simple_roles_desc: "By simplify using our bombers in a single role, bombing, we can focus on increasing their destructive capacity. Previously, bombers have been outfitted with a variety of laser weaponry, turrets, and other various additions. Bombers have one job, dropping ordnance on the enemy, and this is what we must focus on."
 imp_blanket_the_skies_desc: "Our starfighters are unique in their design compared to the inhabitants of this world, making an iconic impression on those that see them. If we produce them in large quantities, our already iconic starfighters will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. They will fear the howl of our ion engines."
 imp_research_on_bomber_construction_desc: "Instead of using outdated models, we should turn our attention to the future; we should strive to develop new methods with which to wage war. Newer bombers will be faster, more defensible, and deliver a much more destructive blow to its targets."

We must invest into their development."
 imp_improved_gunship_turrets_desc: "Improving the turrets on our existing and future models to allow a wider firing arc lets our gunships focus more on flying the correct course instead of aligning the ship to allow gunners to fire at the enemy, making both of their roles easier to fulfil. Further armoring of gun positions also allows our gunners to survive a direct hit from enemy attacks and continue firing, greatly increasing survivability."
 imp_simplify_assembly_process_desc: "As it stands, gunships are a time intensive craft to make. Simplifying this process will allow us to create more, which we desperately need in order to keep up with our growing ground forces."
 imp_a_rain_of_fire_desc: "Having double, even triple, the standard amount of gunships per trooper deployment will be an incredible boost to the destructive capability our ground forces are able to inflict, no enemy can withstand a barrage of rockets and laser cannon fire that a squadron of our gunships are capable of outputting."
 imp_land_air_cooperation_desc: "By assigning our gunships to our ground commanders rather than our Imperial Air Corps, we can allow our commanders to use them at their own discretion rather than having to place a request for support."
 imp_air_doctrine_refinement_desc: "Focusing on destroying our enemies capacity to fight will cripple their front line troops, as if we destroy the factories, we destroy our enemies ability to arm its own men. Nothing can withstand the firepower of the Imperial Air Corp."

Speeders work as a poor-man's light tank, easy to produce in numbers but incredibly vulnerable. The 'Speeder' can be mixed in with 'Walkers' to essentially create cheap light tank units at the cost of efficiency, or you could have a light brigade full of speeders to move at incredible speeds. These Vehicles are best paired with Armored Transports."

 imperial_economicstory.1.t: "The Imperial Council"
 imperial_economicstory.1.d: "Back within the galaxy far far away, the Galactic Empire had a Imperial Council sometimes referred to as the Imperial Ruling Council. Council was a collective body of beureaucrats composed of the Emperor's closest advisors, and other members of the court. The Imperial Council was merely seen as 'yes men' by many observers. But in fact, the council managed the many daily affairs of the Empire, and they wieled considerable powers. All of the moffs, generals, and admirals reported to the Council however, they were not exactly privy to Imperial Intelligence ongoings. \n\nThe situation of the Executor and the current state of our government aspects are in flux. Reestablishing the Imperial Council but making the necessary changes to have them directly answer to Executor's Leader will warrant a needed heirarchy. \n\nNew Imperial Council shall oversee once more the daily activities of the Empire upon this planet, however they will not interfere with military operations. Council shall instead focus on civil manners helping to navigate the lives of Imperial citizens and those whom we integrate into ourselves. \n\nAs the Imperial Council is established, we shall need to give them a temporary goal to work towards. \n\nCouncil could help with the industrialization of certain key sectors across our newly accquired lands or the Council could branch out to explore establishing a system of service for the Empire, this should surely open up new recruitment possibilites."

 imperial_economicstory.2.d: "From the collection of information, this planet only underwent an industrial revolution not too long before our arrival. Though, it is was puny attempt at industrializing their lands--Imperial engineering is still light years ahead of whatever the local populace of 'Earth' have developed in their generations. \n\nWith the Rapid Industrialization effort across the Empire's new territories, some issues have arisen due to the horrible development of the lands across this planet. We are growing scarce on resources having to divert many of the required resources of the war effort towards bolstering our new industry. If we cannot met the demands of the war with our a sizeable industry then we will never conquer the entirity of this world. It is with best interest we take a cut to our resources for the time being until the rapid industrialization effort is finished."

 imperial_economicstory.3.d: "Due to the rapid expansion we are currently undergoing due to the conquests of new lands, we must reform the Imperial Citizenship. This is an absolute necessity for order and organization amongst the new land. \n\nBack within our galaxy, Galactic Empire had three classes of citizenship. Each of these classes were based upon genetic makeup, more specifically how close a species was to that of a human. Each of the three classes held different status, privilege, and rights within Imperial Law. And classes were further differentiated by the various service opportunities provided by the Empire. \n\nDue to the inhabitants of this world all being of the human species, we cannot simply go about the same ways of life that we once had. So, a new system shall be instated. \n\nClass A Citizenship will grant full and unrestricted rights as Imperial citizens, with no limits on service, position, or rank. This class of citizenship shall either be attained through blood, sweat, and tears poured out for the Empire, or through the lands which we deem our new brothers and sisters. Class B citizenship will grant fill rights as citizens but they will be limited in their service options. Rank and Position of a higher status will not be permitited, B class will be granted to those people we deem to still be voitale against the Empire's goals. And Class C citizenship will only provide basic and limited rights. They shall be subjected to forced labor by those we provide with proper Slaver Permits. \n\nThe rest of the information shall be forwarded to the newly reinstated Imperial Citizenship Bureau under the Imperial Council."

 imperial_economicstory.4.d: "Coruscant was the Imperial Center of the entire Empire. A planet covered completely in one city, and regarded as the homeworld of humanity. Thousands of years of development destroyed the planet's ancient mountains and seas. Planet's surface was an urban sprawl, dense city blocks were built atop one another. As brillant as the top side planet city was, Coruscant was also hwoever starved below by an underworld beneath the surface full of dark alleys and an abundance of crimnals wanted by the Empire. \n\nWe may never again see the sights of the Imperial City on the surface or even the wretched underbelly that has somehow become nostaglic within the remaining Imperial minds of the original surviving crew of the Executor, but we can terraform our surrondings to provide a familiar and better home. \n\nNorthern Perimeter serves as a perfect location for this massive terraform project. A whole new Imperial City will eventually stand towering over all this world has to over, and all the populace of this world shall kneel before the Empire."

 imperial_economicstory.5.d: "Imperial Senate was once the Galactic Senate filled by various senators from various systems controlled by then Galactic Republic. Senate was transformed into more of a legislative assembly that became the Imperial Senate when the Empire was formed. \n\nMany of the Executor's Imperials have varying opinions on if we should truly be reinstuting this system or if it is just better left being dissolved. \n\nIn any case, the decision has been made to remake the Senate, but considering the Senate will be dealing with many civic matters and occasionally matters that could affect the Imperial Military, it is best to secretly emplace a majority of Imperial loyalists to prevent any unneccassary occurences from arising."

With the rise of the Empire, this was quickly shifted into an Imperial Senate that operated more as a ceramonial position. \n\nThe Imperials whom crashed on the Executor believe that shifting the senate into a 'yes man' to the Emperor was a mistake, and now only voiced this opinion due to our situation on this planet. \n\nWhile it would be in our best interest to attempt to create an Imperial centered Senate, perhaps leaving it autonomy could allow us to gain much popularity with the populace. As long as the Empire survives, some small sacrifices can be made."

New Imperials dot the streets at every possible turn and position, there is never a quiet night within the city. Perhaps members of the Executor crew can truly forget where they originally came from, or perhaps it will never leave. \n\nEmpire has truly accomplished a miracle of industrialization and terraforming upon this planet. Empire shall once more stride across the stars, and this is just the beginning. Perhaps a new galaxy awaits us..."

 imperial_story.0.t: "Introduction"
 imperial_story.0.d: "\"Executrix is an attempt to restructure the original storyline so that it's more consistent, makes sense, and doesn't ruin the integrity of canon. This also means all references to the First Order have been removed. Executrix is meant to be an Executor 2.0, so for all intents and purposes, this is a successor to the original mod. I will leave the original mod on the workshop for anyone that wishes to replay that experience.\" \n-MasterVeo1, Developer of Executor\n\nThe Original Tarkin/Vader path has been restructured and there will eventually be an alternative route available in the future.\n\nIf you have any feedback, leave it on the official Executor Discord which can be found on the mod's steam page. \n\n--STORY--\n\nAfter taking the nearly completed Executrix for a test flight accompanied by many high ranking officials in the Imperial Army and Navy, catastrophe struck. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a many hour jump through hyperspace, Executrix was suddenly lurched into the gravity well of an unknown planet due to one of the main reactors of the ship failing. This sent the Executor crashing down onto the surface. Thankfully due to the skill of the entire crew, we were able to use the remaining engines to move ourselves over land, narrowly escaping a watery grave. We ended up crashing in a vast sea of sand dunes.\n\nLord Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin are both present on the ship due to their personal oversight in the launch of the Super Star Destoryer. Vader and Tarkin are currently discussing whom shall over see the upcoming recovery operations.\n\nCrew is in disarray as the Executor is badly damaged in the crash, navigation systems are completely fried and there is no telling where they are. Both Vader and Tarkin are adept in their fields but the choice of whom shall oversee the upcoming events could shape the future of the surviving crew..."

 imperial_story.1.t: "Tarkin leads the Executor's Operations"
 imperial_story.1.d: "With Grand Moff Tarkin at the helm of the Executor's operations, the Imperial Army breathes a short sigh of relief. Many of the survivng Imperials whom were left after the Executor's crash have good faith in the choice of Tarkin to lead. \n\nTarkin is considered a War Hero to the Imperial public having served for many years in the Clone Wars. His contributions and efforts alone shaped many victories for the Republic having served as a Captain and eventually Admiral. Tarkin is known to lead the Imperial Navy effectively for years as much of his doctrines and strategy permeate the Imperial Navy and Army.\n\nOur men have confidence that perhaps they will once again see home, though the troops are bit fearful of the Dark Lord's presence. With Tarkin helming as the Head of Operations, Vader will oversee the Imperial forces in person..."
 imperial_story.1.a: "Perhaps there is still a chance."
 imperial_story.2.t: "Vader leads the Executor's Operations"
 imperial_story.2.d: "With Lord Vader at the helm of the Executor's operations, the Dark Lord will ensure order and fear not only to the populace of this world but to the crew of the Executor.\n\nMany of the Imperial Troopers whom survived the crash are noticeably anxious about Lord Vader's new position of authority. It is known throughout the crew on the atrocities the Dark Lord has committed in the name of the Galactic Empire and especially, the Emperor. \n\nTalk and rumors has broken out among the crew already that may not see home again for quite some time as Vader's ambitions have never stop short of anything but grand. Much of these rumors stem from the Outer Rim conquest which still lives in the memory of the crew. This was a series of conflicts that immediatly took place after the Empire arised from the Republic's undoing. Vader led many operations in the suppression of CIS elements including bringing many worlds into the Empire's control. The fighting was bitter on certain fronts such as Mimban where the probability of death for an Imperial soldier was 70%.\n\nThough, Grand Moff Tarkin has assured the troops worries with him being at the helm of the ground forces but time will only tell who the correct choice to lead the Executor's Operations was if any choice was a good one to begin with ..."

 imperial_story.3.d: "REPORT: STAR CHART MISALLIGMENT \n\nThe Navigation Officers left abroad the Executor have made little to no progress in determinig the location of this planet.\n\nIn the attempts to map our current position, Officers have been entirely stumped as to the current whereabouts of the Executor.\n\n Our original course plan was to take the hyperspace lane from Kuat Drive Yards to Fondor however it would appear that a sudden error in the navigation systems caused great miscalucations. This error was caused by a gravitional anamoly that overswept the Executor that seem to originate from the Mandalore system but it is nothing of importance to this report.\n\nBy our Navigations’ best estimates and theories, Executor somehow overshot the hyperspace route and went into the Unknown Regions. Vast uncharted and dangerous territories of the Unknown Regions have baffled even the older civilizations that predate the republic... no star charts come even close to our predicted location and the Navigators findings only bring about dread..."

 imperial_story.4.t: "Report: Reconstruction Discovery"
 imperial_story.4.d: "REPORT: RECONSTRUCTION DISCOVERY \n\nDuring the examination of the wreckage of the Executor crash site, several inconsistencies were found by Imperial Engineers across the large capital ship. It would appear that the Executor's shield generators were incomplete and never properly implemented into the overall power network that made up the ship leading to a theory that the shield generators could have fried some of the various power grids throughout the Executor as a whole causing one of the main reactors to fry. The investigation yieled even worse discoveries, the shield generators found upon the Exectuor were entirely inadequate for a vessel of our size. \n\nFurther investigation into the Exectuor's failure will continue..."

 imperial_story.5.d: "REPORT: FOR HIGH COMMAND EYES ONLY \n\nWith the recent discovery and investigation into the shielding of the Executor being completely inadequate for a vessel of its size--the Navigation Officers' have reconsidered their calculations... we are somewhere between 13 and 15 million lightyears from the nearest recognizable galaxy. \n\nEven with the new calculations, it would seem as if years have passed in our galaxy, projections estimate that our galaxy would be thousands of years from now and a great deal of time would have passed by...  this is obviously...unfathomable. \n\nTo everyone abroad this ship, we will never see our homes again. Even if we made the required repairs to the Exectuor and went out of the orbit to make the jump back, it has been over a thousand years since we left. Everything we knew, everything that once was ... is gone... this shall be my last report to the Command of this Vessel... signing off."

 imperial_story.6.d: "REPORT: FOR HIGH COMMAND EYES ONLY\n\nThe Fate of the Executor and her crew is too dreadful for any one such person to bear.\n\nAs the new Officer in charge of bringing up these reports and investigations, I would advise that revealing any ounce of the truth to the crew still with us would destroy the morale of every crewman from trooper to admiral alike.\n\nFirst, we must suppress the outcome of what transpired. The previvous officer who had made the original investigations and subsequent reports shortly took his own life out of sheer grief. This outcome will more than likely be common amongst the remaining Imperials.\n\nSecondly, Suppressing the truth will be a difficult task as we took no precautions to the original investigations; we had not expected the results of the Executor's failure to be so drastic. Most of the crew knew that the investigations were taking place. Most navigation officers, as well as their aides and superiors know of what has transpired and what the fate of everyone of all Imperilas left is... we shall do our best to cover up any information from leaking out, but it is safe to assume the worst. It is the silent gaze that tells all, it is clear that each Imperial can guess or knows what has happened and is simply burying the truth within.\n\nWe shall follow the upcoming situations closely."

It only seems fair that we share what the investigations discovered with all Imperials, as every single one of us are affected equally; we are all stranded together upon an unknown world forever lost from our home. \n\nIt was widely and secretly accepted without conversation that the Executor's fate was the worst. Confirmation alone will only and obviously depress many, and we may even see men break down entirely. Preivous officer whom made the investigations reports took his own life shorter after delivering the final report to high command, and this will be common amognst many. This is the reality of our situation now, everything we once knew is gone but perhaps we can salavge what remains..."

Various rumors have spread and some are the truth. These rumors most likely originated with our Junior Officers, who consisted of the Navigational Officers who were the most informed of our predicament due to the investigations.\n\nWe must address the concerns of the men, as anymore waiting will only make it seems as though we are hiding the truth, but it is clear that confirmation of what happened would only confirm their darkest fears which most have started to accept..."

Several splinter groups have already formed, led by various admirals and generals all wanting to reforge the Empire in their own image. Our own troopers no longer follow orders, and march behind the banner of Yularen, while the natives rise behind Mikhail Tuchakevsky; the Junior Officer Corps have taken the Outer Regions for themselves.

We can first try to save the survivors of this city and persuade them that we were shot down by a neighboring nation and put the blame on them. The alternative would be to execute the remaining survivors and keep our 'landing' secret which would also allows us to harvest the resources of the area without restriction. \n\nThis choice could have ramifications in the future..."

Recovering the component of the ship would be near impossible without risking exposure.

Serving as Leader of Imperial 7th Fleet before the subseqeunt crash, Thrawn was present upon the Executor for its test flight and has since been helping military actions throughout the Planet. Imperial Leadership especially Thrawn have not been keen with Tarkin's actions following the crash. Thrawn will devise an immediate termination."
